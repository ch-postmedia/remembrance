More than 650,000 men and women from Canada and Newfoundland served — more than 66,000 died and over 172,000 were wounded. The fighting ended on Nov. 11, 1918, with the signing of the Armistice.

It marked the first time Canada declared war on its own accord. More than one million Canadians and Newfoundlanders served, with more than 55,000 wounded and over 45,000 dead.

</div>
		<div>Second battle of Ypres (WW1)</div>
		<div>April 22, 1915</div>
		<div>In Canada’s first major battle, the outnumbered division faced the first use of chlorine gas as a battlefield agent. An enormous green-yellow gas cloud, several kilometres long, devastated the French lines, exposing the Canadian left flank. Units shifted positions to cover the gap, but the German gas attack had torn a huge hole in the Allied line. Outnumbered, outgunned, and outflanked, on the 24th they faced a direct chlorine gas attack. The Canadians bought precious time for British troops to be rushed forward, but at a terrible price — 6,000 dead or wounded over four days.</div>

		<div>In Canada’s first major battle, the outnumbered division faced the first use of chlorine gas as a battlefield agent. An enormous green-yellow gas cloud, several kilometres long, devastated the French lines, exposing the Canadian left flank. Units shifted positions to cover the gap, but the German gas attack had torn a huge hole in the Allied line. Over three days, the Canadians fought tenaciously to defend this exposed position. Outnumbered, outgunned, and outflanked, on the 24th they faced a direct chlorine gas attack. The Canadians bought precious time for British troops to be rushed forward, but at a terrible price — 6,000 dead or wounded over four days.</div>
		<div>The seven-kilometre long Vimy Ridge in northern France, near Arras, held a commanding view over the surrounding countryside. Previous unsuccessful French and British attacks had suffered over 150,000 casualties; the British High Command ordered the Canadian Corps to capture the position. At 5:30 a.m. on April 9 nearly 1,000 guns opened fire on the German positions. An estimated 15,000 Canadians rose from the trenches and advanced towards the ridge in the first wave, with thousands more behind them. The Canadians captured the ridge by April 12, at a cost of 10,600 wounded and killed. </div>

		<div>The seven-kilometre long Vimy Ridge in northern France, near Arras, held a commanding view over the surrounding countryside. Previous unsuccessful French and British attacks had suffered over 150,000 casualties. The British High Command ordered the Canadian Corps to capture the position as part of a larger spring offensive. At 5:30 a.m. on April 9 nearly 1,000 guns opened fire on the German positions. An estimated 15,000 Canadians rose from the trenches and advanced towards the ridge in the first wave, with thousands more behind them.

		<div>Aug. 8, 1918</div>
		<div>The offensive at Amiens was a surprise assault based on a combined arms approach to war. The infantry attacked behind a creeping artillery barrage, supported by tanks, cavalry, armoured cars, and tactical airpower. On Aug. 8, the Canadians advanced 13 km through the German defences, the most successful day of combat for the Allies on the Western Front. But the Germans rushed reinforcements to the battlefield, and the fighting became far more difficult. But Amiens marked the beginning of the end for the German armies. In the months to come, Canadians would suffer more than 11,800 killed and wounded.</div>

		<div>Battle of Passchendaele (WW1)</div>
		<div>Oct. 26-Nov. 10, 1917</div>
		<div>After months of fighting in Flanders, Passchendaele ridge was still held by German troops. The Allied offensive was mired in a vast bog of bodies and mud. Sir Douglas Haig, the commander-in-chief of the British Expeditionary Force, ordered the Canadians to deliver victory. The Canadian Corps built new roads, fortified gun pits and moved thousands of shells to the front in preparation for the battle. The Canadians finally attacked on Oct. 26 and the battle raged until the ridge was captured in mid-November, with 15,000 Canadians killed and wounded. The British suffered  270,000 casualties.</div>

		<div>After months of fighting in Flanders, Passchendaele ridge was still stubbornly held by German troops. The Allied offensive was mired in a vast bog of bodies and mud. Sir Douglas Haig, the commander-in-chief of the British Expeditionary Force, ordered the Canadians to deliver victory. The Canadian Corps, under Sir Arthur Currie, built new roads, fortified gun pits and moved thousands of shells to the front in preparation for the battle. The Canadians finally attacked on Oct. 26 and the battle raged until the ridge was captured in mid-November, at a cost of more than 15,000 Canadians killed and wounded. The British, meanwhile, lost an estimated 270,000 casualties.</div>
		<div>Aug. 19, 1942</div>
		<div>Five thousand troops of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, along with a thousand British troops, many of them commandos, attacked the French port of Dieppe on the English Channel Coast. The results were disastrous. After nine hours fighting ashore, the force withdrew. Over 1,000 were dead and 2,000 taken prisoner. Behind the failure lay a poor, overly complex plan, insufficient fire support from aircraft and artillery, and inadequate training of troops for their first test of battle. Yet lessons were learned for later amphibious landings in the Mediterranean and at Normandy.</div>

		<div>D-Day: Juno Beach (WW2)</div>
		<div>June 6, 1944</div>
		<div>The long-awaited invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe began with Allied armies from the U.S., Britain and Canada landing on the coast of Normandy. The Canadians landed on Juno Beach, an exposed stretch swept with machine gun fire. They stormed the German positions. In fierce hand-to-hand fighting, they forced their way into the towns of Bernières, Courseulles and St. Aubin, securing a critical bridgehead for the Allied invasion. The victory was a turning point in World War II and led to the liberation of Europe and the defeat of Nazi Germany. About 1,200 Canadians were killed and wounded.</div>

		<div>On D-Day, June 6, 1944, the long-awaited invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe began with Allied armies from the U.S., Britain and Canada landing on the coast of Normandy. The 3rd Canadian Infantry Division landed on Juno Beach. The Canadians raced across exposed beaches swept with machine gun fire, and stormed the German positions. In fierce hand-to-hand fighting, they forced their way into the towns of Bernières, Courseulles and St. Aubin and then advanced inland, securing a critical bridgehead for the Allied invasion. The victory was a turning point in World War II and led to the liberation of Europe and the defeat of Nazi Germany. About 1,200 Canadians were killed and wounded.</div>
		<div>Sept.-Oct., 1918</div>
		<div>The Canadians opened their attack on Aug. 26, opening up an intense, week-long battle, resulting in more than 11,000 Canadian casualties. The Canadians finally broke through the German line on Sept. 2 and launched another high-risk attack across the Canal du Nord on Sept. 27. Behind a complicated fire plan and the work of engineers, the Corps crossed the canal and pushed through the enemy defences, eventually capturing Bourlon Wood and Cambrai on Oct. 9. The battles cost over 30,000 Canadian casualties but helped break the
German army’s final defensive positions.</div>
